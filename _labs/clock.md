In this lab will implement a simple real-time clock application, that will print the current time, using **printf()**, in a terminal window that is connected to the PYNQ system. 

## Objectives 
* Write an interrupt-driven user-space application.
* Gain practice using your GPIO and interrupt controller drivers.

## Preliminary 

### Software Stack 

Review the [Software Stack]({% link _documentation/software_stack.md %}) that illustrates how the different software modules you will create in this class will work together.  Make note of the provided [system.h](https://github.com/byu-cpe/ecen427_student/blob/master/userspace/drivers/system.h) file.

## Implementation 

Complete the real-time clock application.  Some starting code is provided to you: [clock.cpp](https://github.com/byu-cpe/ecen427_student/blob/master/userspace/apps/clock/clock.cpp).  Requirements:
  1. **Print format:** 
      * Time is printed to the terminal in the following 24-hour format (includes leading zero): HH:MM:SS
      * The time display in the terminal emulator is stationary; it does not scroll, etc. Search online to see how to clear the terminal window between each print of the time in order to make the display stationary.
  1. **Incrementing each second:**
      * The time display will be updated each second (except when pushing buttons, which will cause it to update more frequently).
  1. **Setting Time:**
     * When the user presses a button, the hour, minute or second value should be incremented/decremented, and the displayed time should be updated immediately.  
     * BTN0, BTN1, BTN2 are the second, minute, and hour buttons, respectively.
     * SW0 is the increment/decrement switch. Increment when SW0 is up, decrement when SW0 is down. You should be able to change the position of SW0 while holding the hour, minute, or second button and have the clock do the right thing, i.e., switch from increment to decrement and vice versa. 
     * If more than one of the hour, minute, or second button are simultaneously pressed, you can choose whatever behavior you like.
     * When you are incrementing/decrementing using the buttons, you can choose whether rollover cascades or not.  For example, if you are incrementing the minutes from 59 to 00, you can choose whether the hours value increments by one or not.
     * Your implementation must tolerate the user pushing any combination of buttons. It shouldn't do anything strange (like display an illegal time, for example), and it must not die, no matter what combination of buttons are pushed. 
  1. **Button Debouncing:**
     * Each press of the button should only increment/decrement its respective value by 1 (unless held down, see next requirement).  This will require debouncing the button inputs. Some discussion on this is provided later on this page.
  1. **Fast Increment/Decrement:**
     * If a button is held down for 1/2 second or more, the time should increment/decrement every 0.1 seconds, as long as the button is held down.  You don't need to worry about counting time while a button is held down.


### Interrupt / Debouncing Requirements
Since the goal of the lab is to give you experience making use of interrupts, there are some requirements you must follow:

  1. You must use the interrupt output of the fixed-interval timer (FIT) to keep track of time (eg incrementing the clock each second, auto-incrementing when holding down the button, etc.). You are not allowed to use sleep functions, or other operating system functions (eg. sleep(), \<chrono\>, etc.) to keep track of time.
  1. You must use interrupts to receive data from the push-buttons. More specifically, the buttons can only be read when its associated GPIO module generates an interrupt. **You are not allowed to poll the buttons, including using the FIT interrupt to poll the buttons.**
  1. You must de-bounce the push buttons. You won't get full credit if you have bouncy buttons. The TA will be testing for this.
  1. The push buttons must be very responsive. The TAs will test your implementation by tapping the buttons rapidly to check for responsiveness. Your implementation must be able to respond to pushbuttons that are pushed more than once per second.
  1.  Depending how you choose to structure your code, you probably won't need to use the interrupt for the switches, since you should never be stopped waiting for a switch to change value.  It's fine to just read the current switch value directly from the driver using `switches_read()` when you need the value.

## Suggestions

  1. Looks at the *interrupt_test* application, which can help you structure your overall code.
  1. Consider creating a simple program that prints a ”.” to the screen once each second, using the FIT. This is mostly about verifying that you can get the FIT interrupt to work.
  1. Consider creating a simple program that prints a ”#” each time you press and release any push-button. This is mostly about verifying that you can get the button interrupts to work.
  1. Debouncing can be trickly.  I suggest this approach:    
      a. Have a variable that keeps track of how long it has been since the button value changed.
      b. When the button generates an interrupt, reset this count to 0, and store the button value in a temporary location.      
      c. When the FIT ISR generates an interrupt, increase this count.  If the count reaches a certain threshold (your debounce time), then copy the temporary button value to a variable (this is your *debounced button value*).  Only use this debounced button value elsewhere in your code, and not the raw button value.  
  1. Other than various initializations and set up, your `main()` must contain only a while(1) loop that waits for interrupts to occur. If the loop has anything else then you are probably doing the forbidden, a.k.a. polling.
