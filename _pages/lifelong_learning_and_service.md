## Overview

Starting with Lab 2, **10% of each lab grade** will be dedicated to supporting BYU's Aim of "Lifelong Learning and Service" (Lab 4 is excluded since it is group work). 

Lifelong learning is a critical skill for success as a computer engineer. Technology evolves rapidly, and the ability to independently learn new concepts, tools, and techniques will be essential throughout your career. This component encourages you to practice self-directed learning beyond what is taught in class.

Service is equally important, especially when working with others on a team. Helping teammates understand difficult concepts, debugging issues together, and sharing knowledge strengthens both your team and your own understanding. These collaborative skills are vital in professional engineering environments.

## Options

For each lab, you must complete **one** of the following options:

### Option 1: Lifelong Learning

Spend **at least 15 minutes** learning something new on your own that wasn't taught in class. This should be:
- Related to the class topics (embedded systems, Linux, device drivers, hardware/software integration, etc.), **OR**
- Inspired by something in the class materials

Examples include:
- Exploring a Linux kernel subsystem we didn't cover
- Learning about a related technology or tool
- Reading documentation or articles about embedded systems concepts
- Experimenting with features beyond the lab requirements

### Option 2: Service

Help another student in the class by:
- Answering their questions
- Helping them debug their code
- Explaining concepts they're struggling with
- Assisting them in the lab

## Submission

For each lab, create a text file with one or two sentences describing what you learning, or service you provided. The file should be placed in your repository at:

```
learning_and_service/<lab_name>.txt
```

Use the following lab names for your files:
- `lab2.txt`
- `lab3.txt`
- `lab5_m1.txt`
- `lab5_m2.txt`
- `lab5_m3.txt`
- `lab5_m4.txt`
- `lab6_m1.txt`
- `lab6_m2.txt`
- `lab7.txt`
- `lab8.txt`
