In the labs for this class, you will be completing some tasks on your computer, and some tasks on the PYNQ board.  In this setup step, you will set up your Git repository and SSH keys on both your computer and the PYNQ board.  


## Computer Setup
> üìù Run this on your computer.


### Register your SSH Key with Github


  - Run  `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to display your public key.  Copy the entire outputted text, including the `ssh-rsa` at the beginning and computer address at the end.
  - Go to <https://github.com/settings/keys>, click *New SSH key* button, and paste your key in the *Key* box.  Give your key a name (like *caedm*) and click *Add SSH key* to save the key.
  - Check that you can now authenticate with Github by running
  
        ssh -T git@github.com  
        
    You should see a message like this:
  
        Hi <your_github_username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.


### Github Repository Creation
1. Sign up for your Github classroom repo using this link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/-sHbStcV> This will create an empty private repository on Github for you to use throughout the entire semester. **You must create your repository using this link, or the TAs will not be able to grade your code.**

1. You should now see the message below.  Click the link to navigate to your repository.
<img src = "{% link media/setup/git_classroom1.png %}" width="800" >
  
1. Your repository will begin empty, but you will need to import the starter code.  To do this we will do a bare clone of the starter code repository, and push it to your repository.  Then you can delete this clone.  Make sure to replace the URL in the third step with the URL of your repository, that you can find by clicking the *SSH* button on your repository page.  You can run these commands in any directory you want. 

        git clone --bare git@github.com:byu-cpe/ecen427_student.git
        cd ecen427_student.git/
        git push --mirror git@github.com:byu-ecen427-classroom/427-labs-jgoeders.git
        cd ..
        rm -rf ecen427_student.git


### Clone your Repo

  - Go to your newly created repo.  
  - Click the **Code** button, and then the **Use SSH** link, as shown here: 
    <img src = "{% link media/setup/git_classroom3.png %}" width="800" >
  - Copy the URL that is shown.  It should be something like: *git@github.com:byu-cpe-classroom/427-labs-\<your_id\>.git*
  - Clone the repository into a directory you want to use, for example:  

        git clone <github_ssh_address> ~/ecen427

  - Open this in VS Code by running `code ~/ecen427`



### Add Starter Code Remote 

  - When you clone your repo, Git will create a *remote* called *origin* that is connected to your repo. 
  - You can view your remotes by typing `git remote`, and even check the linked URL by typing `git remote get-url origin`.
  - Next, you should add a new remote.  You can call it whatever you like, but a good name is *startercode*.  This remote will link to the starter code repository.  This will allow you to retrieve any updates I make to the code provided to you (I will probably need to make some updates to the code during the semester).  You do this like so:

        git remote add startercode https://github.com/byu-cpe/ecen427_student


Then, if you ever need to pull down changes I make, you can do the following to fetch the latest changes from the starter code and merge them into your code:
  
    git fetch startercode
    git merge startercode/main

## PYNQ Setup

> üìù Run this on the PYNQ board

### Create SSH Key
Create an SSH key on the PYNQ by running `ssh-keygen` (you can just hit *Enter* a bunch of times to skip the prompts).
This will create two files in your `~/.ssh` directory: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.  The `id_rsa` file is your private key, and the `id_rsa.pub` file is your public key (The filenames are different than when you ran ssh-keygen on the lab computers, because the different Ubuntu versions in the lab versus the board have different default key formats).  **Do not share your private key with anyone.**

### Register with Github

Follow the same steps as above to register your PYNQ public key with Github.  Check that you can now authenticate with Github by running 

    ssh -T git@github.com
  
### Clone your Repo on the PYNQ

Follow the same steps as above to clone your repo on the PYNQ.  

### Configure Git 

Since this is the first time using Git on the PYNQ system, you need to configure it.  Run these commands (**making sure to enter your name and email**):
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
```
